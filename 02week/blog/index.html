    <h1>Future Comic Genius</h1>
    <p>Every day brings a variety of excitement and disappointment. The comedic
    genius of my little buddy C.A. blows my mind. Most of his doodles are of scary
    monsters from movies and video games, but every few pages, he'll sneak in
    a few gems like these. I hope you like them as much as I do.</p>

    <h1>Mixed to Improper and Back Again!</h1>
    <p>These are the steps we use for visual learners:
    <ol>
      <li>Draw one whole</li>
      <li>"Cut" it into the fraction-sized pieces</li>
      <li>Label each piece starting with one</li>
      <li>Draw another whole and "cut" it</li>
      <li>Keep counting up until you get to the numerator</li>
      <li>Lightly shade all of the numbered pieces</li>
      <li>The whole number is the number of wholes complete shaded</li>
      <li>The fraction is how much is shaded in the last fraction</li>
    </ol></p>
