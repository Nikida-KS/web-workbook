    <h1>Future Comic Genius</h1>
    <p>Every day brings a variety of excitement and disappointment. The comedic
    genius of my little buddy C.A. blows my mind. Most of his doodles are of scary
    monsters from movies and video games, but every few pages, he'll sneak in
    a few gems like these. I hope you like them as much as I do.</p>
